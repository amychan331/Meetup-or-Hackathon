# Meetup-or-Hackathon
A repo for the code I worked on for the Meetup event Pairup. The exercise is part of the Pair Up Javascript Level 2 Exercise. 
The team composed of Amy Yuen Ying Chan, Lena Zheng, and Kai Yun Pekarsky.
The goal is to create a member card game.
The cards should be inside a table, face-down.
When clicked, the card flips, showing an image sourced by an url that contain a number. 
If both cards that was selected has the same url number, the two card remains face-up.
The url should be inside an array. The url should be randomized. 
The code should include a click handler and a timeout handler.

Images folder is not included because the images are randomly selected from Google based on which one looks the funnist for the team member at the time of Meetup.
As such, copyright cannot be determined.
However, image names are numbered from 1 to 8. If you want to play with this code, feel free to use any images you like. Have fun!
